jira: complete calib events only requirement
https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CTP-25

LED-events in EMC are generated by PP coming to EMC from CTP
as part of calibration events.
LED events are followed by calibration L0 (CL0), 
PP-CL0 distance is 60 BCs for EMC.
It may happen, there is another physics event between PP and CL0,
discarding CL0.
EMC requirement is to disable such cases (e.g. in run 263866 there were
411 attempts to send cal. trigger, but only 355 were complete).

Possible solutions:
1. Disable A-(C-)masks between pre-pulse and calibration BCs.
2. Use a special L0 input for calibration triggers
3. raise CTP busy (using sw) after issuing pre-pulse to make sure HW triggers
   do not kill calib. triggers.
  - All/Rare mechanism, or raise cluster busy?
4. gcalib daemon writes info about all the pre-pulses 
   in the output file for each global run.  Using this file, 
   LED-events (especially those not followed by CL0) can
   be filtered out in offline data.

Todo:
1. Do step4, find 'CL0 missing' cases in technical(physics) runs
2. When understood better, do step3 
3. If step3 not feasible try step2 or step1.

todo (step 4.):
- ctp_proxy/gcalib.c
  - introduce 'period' counting (solely in gcalib)
    0: at SOD, initialise orbitn_last -> will be used for period++
    - see orbitn_last, daqperiod, seems at SOD we need
      to store ACTIVEDETS[ix].daqperiod =0 and orbit_sod= current orbit,
      and then to keep actual daqperiod+orbit for each calibrated detector.
   'todo later...'
  - introduce run# for each detector
    1. from redis db or 
    2. change cshmGlobalDets: seems better to modify cshmGlobalDets returning 
       also array of global runs (like redis)
      cshmGlobalDets: called only from
      swtrigger.c
      gcalib.c
    done, i.e. modified: cshmGlobalDets, addDET
  - introduce meaningfull rc after each GenSwtrg.
    rc now:
    N (1) -number of generated events (ok)
    12345678 -det not active
    rc new: valid in case of 1 CL0 trigger only!
    flag 1..10 (4 ok)   -i.e. RC is: 0xffffff00 | flag
    done 19.12.2016 (special RC in case of 'one calib trigger'
  - open file ppN.data for each run if at least 1 cal. detector is in
    maybe: 'only if emcal is in' ?
  - write one line for each cal. event: 
    det period orbitid rc
  - close at EOD
- swtrigger.c   -modify startswtrig() to return meaningfull rc 
  (as said  above for GenSwtrg)
- modify all programs checking rc from GenSwtrg() -probably
  not needed ( one CL0 generated ONLY from gcalib.c)
