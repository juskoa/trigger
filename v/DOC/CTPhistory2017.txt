=== 29.3.2017 ipcs -m problem
rcmd 'ipcs -m'
- shoudl respond for all LTUs with something like:
------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status      
0x00810000 0          trigger    666        340        2     <--- PROBLEM
0x00811000 32769      trigger    666        340        2                       
0x00812000 65538      trigger    666        340        2                       
0x00813000 98307      trigger    666        340        2  

Seems shmid=0 is remnant from reboot -somehow it happens, that ltuproxy
when started automatically after reboot gets shmid:0. Seems this is wrong -
at least ReadTemperature() (ltucheck.py temp) does not work properly
for some LTUs...
shmid:0 is usually assigned to the ltu with dial:0
