1. Installation
---------------
C and C++ examples of DIM clients using CTP dim services: 
"CTPDIM/MONCOUNTERS" -CTP counters monitoring
"CTPDIM/SWTRG"       -software trigger requesting

Compilation of the client: 
1. Modify SFX, CC variables in dimccounters.make (C or C++ client).
   (C++ is available only for dimccounters)
2.  make linux/dimccounters       (CTP/LTU counters monitoring)
    or 
    make linux/dimcswtrg          (the requests for SW trigger)
3. make linux/server
   CTPDIMt server doesn't have to be compiled, if CTPDIM
   server (real server running with CTP) will be used.
4. start client:
Environment: 
DIM_DNS_NODE=pcald30     (CERN public network)
DIM_DNS_NODE=aldaqecs    (exp. area at Point2)

linux/dimccounters CTPDIM       -connect to CTPDIM server
linux/dimccounters hmpid        -connect to hmpid LTU dim server

The message received from DIM server is array of 32 bits integers as
seen in ctpcounters.h.
The length of this array is 886 words (CTPDIM dim server) 
or 26 (LTU dim servers -one for each LTU).

The description of CTP counters can be found
at ALICE trigger web page (http://www.ep.ph.bham.ac.uk/user/pedja/alice/
-> List of Software notes)

3. cnames.sorted2, ltunames.sorted2
-----------------------------------
The lines of this file contain:
counter_name relative_position_from_0 board_name GTC detector
...
for all the CTP counters. Following 2 files are also in $dbctp directory:
cnames1.sorted2  -valid for run1 (before 2014)
cnames.sorted2   -valid for run2 (from 2014)

Similar file ltunames.sorted2 is supplied for LTU counters, 
published by LTU DIM servers. This file does not contain 5th column
(detector) present in cnames.sorted2.

counter_name 
------------
is the name of the counter, as used in CTP expert software.
From CSTART_SPEC relative position (ctpcounters.h), special
counters are located:
- there are 2 counters (epoch*) for local 
  unix time added by the CTP dim server at the time of reading 
  counters from CTP into memory. These 2 integers keep
  seconds and microseconds from Epoch -as returned by
  gettimeofday() system routine on CTP VME processor.
- orbit number (read from register on L2 board)
- 11 pairs of temperature/volts for each CTP board
- 24 words for LTU voltages (4 voltages packed in 1 word for each LTU)

Special names 'spareX' are used for holes (i.e. not used locations) 
in the message received from dim server.

Special names 'spareXXXrunx' are used for 6 words giving information
about active runs. Non-zero value in these counters denotes the
number of active run (max. 6 active partitions simultaneously running).

counter_name relative_position_from_0
-------------------------------------
relative position of the 32 bit word (from 0) in the array of words
received from dim server

board_name
----------
identifies the CTP board, where the counter is implemented
In the current CTP setup in Birmingham CERN lab, the boards 
FO2,3,4,5,6 are not present.

GTC
---
Type of the counter:
G -Gauge (temperature, voltage,...)
C -Counter (l2orbit, l0counter,...)
T -Timer (1 count corresponds to 400ns time interval. E.g.:busy1...)
S -spare.

detector
--------
This column contains the cabling information taken from VALID.LTUS file.
It can be:
detector_name  (SPD, HMPID,..)
ctp            -if this counter is not related to any LTU
N              -not connected

Example:
byin10 667 busy T MUON_TRK

byin10 is timer read from busy board. BUSY input 10 on busy board
is connected to MUON_TRK LTU.

New counter to be monitored:
- modify dimcdistrib/monnames.txt
- in .c:
#include "udplib.h"
int udpsock;

if(envcmp("VMESITE", "ALICE")==0) {
  udpsock= udpopens("alidcscom026", send2PORT);
} else {
  udpsock= udpopens("pcalicebhm05", send2PORT);
};

sprintf(buffer, "mon ds005 N:%d", tag); 
rc= udpsend(udpsock, (unsigned char *)buffer, strlen(buffer)+1);

4. History

CTPDIM server sends now 23 counters more. The relative
position of counter values in input message is the same. 
New ones are just added at the end -the length of the message is
750 words (before 727). New counters:
orbit: 24 orbit number read from L2 board
temperature,voltages (22 values) 1 pair of words for each board.
See dimccounters2.c example.

value of counters is needed withot waiting for end of monitoring
interval.
23.2.2007
dodif32() corrected (before not correct for the counter overrun)
10.7.2007

20.11.2007
spareXXXrunx   -6 spare counters (allocated for BUSY board) are now
                devoted for the numbers of active runs.
There are 4 counters description files:
cnames.sorted2, the copy of cnames.sorted2.cernlab -describing
          counters in CERN lab
cnames.sorted2.pit -describing counters in experimental area in Point2
