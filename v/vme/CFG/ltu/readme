lvds_tester_e1.rbf
LVDST version e1. see vme/lvdst

ltu_c1.rbf
Trigger input generator. The same funcionality as LTU (standard LTU software
to be used). 3 L0 LVDS outputs can be used as negative inputs for CTP inputs:
L0, L1, L1delayed. See vme/ltu/ltu.h

Thu Sep 25 11:45:12 CEST 2008
ltu_b3.rbf ltuvi_logic_b3.rbf
- LTU BC phase
- rate control by leaky bucket
August 2009
ltu_b4.rbf
max. L2delay 204.8 usecs now (was max 102.4 with ltu_b3.rbf)
13.7.2010
ltu_b5.rbf
RATE_PERIOD 18..8 (was 15..8), step 0.1ms (was 0.82ms),max.period=2048*0.1=204.8ms
16.5.2011 ------------------------------------------------
ltu_b6.rbf  -Antonello's request
Before this: SPARE is output connector with BC, LED signaling global/stdalone mode
From version b6:
Added input "in_spare" from pin L3 as ext_orb (external ORBIT) signal.
The usage of ext_orb signal in stand-alone mode is enabled by writing 1 to
bit 1 in register MODE(H"14D") -0x2  (bit0 is stdalone=1/global=0 bit).
STDALONE_MODE bit 1: 1 - external ORBIT; 0 - internal ORBIT
In Global mode, ORBIT is taken always from ctp_orbit.
Changed "led_drive.signal[7]" from "!ltu_select.stand_alone" to "in_spare"
Added "in_spare" to scope_a.in[15].

ATTENTION:
Old PCBs (LTUs <54) must be modified in order to see ORBIT input (by default SPARE LEMO is output) !
LK1 -> cut, LK21 -> make connection (change output to input)
LK6 -> cut, LK4 -> make connection (change NECL to NIM, if necessary)
Signal from TTCmi is ECL, but AC coupled, so the NIM treshold (-0.47V) is choosen.
New PCBs include these changes.

12.1.2012 ---------------------------------New vs. old LTUs (see ltu.h):
ltu_*.rbf  -old LTU firmware today last one is ltu_b6.rbf
ltu2_*.rbf -new LTU firmware (starting from ltu2_b6.rbf)
Differencies:
- different pinout of FPGA
- CRC error (SEU) bit in 0x5c TEMP_STATUS bit 0x2: 
  1:CRCerror (FPGA have to be reconfigured), 0:ok
- SERIAL_NUMBER is 7 bits (was 6bits), and LTUs serial numbers 
  are > 63, i.e. 64,65,... (seems it is 0 if not scratched on ltu2 board)

3.12.2013
ltu2_b7.rbf  -100 classes CTP emulator (15 words/instruction), NEW BOARDS ONLY
9.1.2013
mv ltu_logic_vB7.rbf ltu_logic_vB7ver1.rbf
new version ltu_logic_vB7.rbf from Marian - new way of generating messages due to time problems
13.1.2013
ltu_logic_vB7ver1.rbf removed, ltu2_b7.rbf is latest version for 100 classes
+ 32bits SLM + timing corrections (an option for compilation)
14.1. 17:30
B7 -seems better timing in FPGA for SSM, but SEU bit (TEMP_STATUS&0x2)
is always set to 1
21.1.2014
ltu2_b8.rbf =ltu2_b7.rbf with functional SEU bit
25.7.2014
ltu2_b9.rbf, ltu_b9.rbf -longer FIFOs, 512 instead of 256 words, and
nearly full condition is set to 208
21.10.2014
LTU_T-1_0.rbf -1st version of LTU-T fy (prepared by Sebastian, sebastian.klewin@cern.ch)
sitting in c26/top crate (alidcsvme004)
21.10.2014
ltu_logic_vBA_for_TRD.rbf
to be loaded into TRD ltu instead of 0xb9, to get it working
with their LTU-T (i.e. 3 L0out connectors on LTU will deliver diffrent
signals)
24.10.2014
LTU_T-1_0_1.rbf
14.10.2014
ltu_logic_verD0.rbf
Special one  for TPC serving as signal converter:
simple conversion from BUSY1 (LVDS) to SPARE OUT (NIM).
8.12.2014
ltu_logic_vD1.rbf
BUSY1 -> PP  i.e. LVDS to NIM
BUSY2 -> L1  i.e. LVDS to ECL
15.12.2014
ltu_logic_vD2.rbf
BUSY1 -> out_prepulse(NIM)),
BUSY2 -> out_L1(ECL) + BUSY(LVDS))
3.3.2015
ltu_logic_BB.rbf, ltu2_logic_BB.rbf
improved timing, TTC-A/B output configurable (Honza)
18.3.2015
ltu2_BC.rbf   (ltu_BC not yet available)
fixed problem with a bit in TTCvi_mode (Marian)
