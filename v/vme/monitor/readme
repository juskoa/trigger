-: no action, i.e. the state not changed

check_rc: -ret. code from do_check() checking the status of a daemon
--------
OFF  -daemon is not running (no pid)
IDLE -is on (pid found), but it is not clear if stuck
ON   -is on and responding (i.e. fresh udp message)
HUNG -not responding (pid found, but stuck)

Actions:
-------
restart:
 - check if on, kill if not on, start daemon
idle:
 - status returned pid: 
   + SPECIAL for readctpc is reporting 'ok tof:l2rate:calrate t0:0:0 ... '

Config:
------
see: allds= in monitor.py main()
     doc in Daemon.__init__()

Control:
------
./monitor.py [re]start &
./monitor.py stop

History:
-------
14.8.
gcalib.sh, udpmon.sh refurbished:
- kill introduced (the same as stop)
- status: rc:0 from startClients.bash if ok (but not used )
todo:
- sms -done (22.8.)
- add another state: idle -i.e. just process is found (by startClients.bash)

27.2.2012 -html added (bin/startClients.bash modified to return pid:N)

Problem:
at SOR/EOR and if time sharing active, it can happen, we get some triggers 
without cal. triggers -particularly for MUON_TRG (calib every 5secs (was 33!)).
Solution: from 22.3.2012
readctp.c should send udp message ONLY if interval is >59secs. 
The interval shorter/equal than 59 secs is discarded and the last 
reading is regarded as '1st reading'.
Before: shorter interval was not considered for calib calculation, 
but the time of previous reading
was stored -i.e. the interval was than included in next interval.

20.7. 2012
pydim added (i.e. startClients.bash returns "pid: ..." if on
i.e. monitor-able daemons now: udpmon pydim html gcalib

17.10. 2012
control better, still not complete...
26.10.2012
ttcmidim instead of pydim i.e., now monitored:
udpmon gcalib ttcmidim html
28.11.2012
udpmon gcalib ctpwsgi ttcmidim html
29.5.2013
autor (autorestart: y|n) option added. pydim added with autor='n'. Now
monitoring: udpmon gcalib ctpwsgi ttcmidim html pydim
14.6.
.html:

system state AUTOR time last
START  STOP        time previous action

24.6.
hddtemp added (sms in case of high temperature, but not when it comes back to normal-
should be done with some hysteresis)
