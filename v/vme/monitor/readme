General notes
-------------
goal: SMS to be sent in case of (to be checked):
- something crashed, i.e.:

- not to be sent if something was started by human intervention

files
-----
udpsend.py -example, send udp to monitor on local machine
threading_miclock.py -example using thread+udp (before included in miclock.py)

check_rc: -ret. code from do_check() checking the status of a daemon
--------
OFF  -daemon is not running (no pid)
IDLE -is on (pid found), but it is not clear if stuck
ON   -is on and responding (i.e. fresh udp message)
HUNG -not responding (pid found, but stuck)

Actions:
-------
restart:
 - check if on, kill if not on, start daemon
idle:
 - status returned pid: 
   + SPECIAL for readctpc is reporting 'ok tof:l2rate:calrate t0:0:0 ... '

State machine (theory):
state   check_rc  action    new state    note
-----------------------------------------------
down    off       start     rstrted      init:down
down    idle      -         ok           init:ok
down    on,msg    -         ok,msg       init:ok
        hung      restart   rstrted      init:down
rstrted off       -         -            try to restart/sms after 1hour?
rstrted idle      -         ok
rstrted on,msg    -         ok
        hung      -         -            sms?
ok      off       start     rstrted  
ok      idle      -         -
ok      on,msg    -         -
        hung      restart   rstrted  

State machine according to monitor.py.main():
state   check_rc  action    new state    note
-----------------------------------------------
down    off       start     rstrted      init:down
ok      off       start     rstrted  
rstrted off       -         -            "DOWN/OK->OFF cannot restart"
                                         try to restart/sms after 1hour?

down    hung      restart   rstrted      init:down
ok      hung      restart   rstrted  
rstrted hung      -         -            "RESTARTED->HUNG cannot restart"
                                         sms?

down    idle      -         ok           init:ok
ok      idle      -         ok
rstrted idle      -         ok

down    on,msg    -         ok,msg       init:ok
rstrted on,msg    -         ok
ok      on,msg    -         ok

-: no action, i.e. the state not changed


Config:
------
see: allds= in monitor.py main()
     doc in Daemon.__init__()

Control:
------
./monitor.py [re]start &
./monitor.py stop

History:
-------
14.8.
gcalib.sh, udpmon.sh refurbished:
- kill introduced (the same as stop)
- status: rc:0 from startClients.bash if ok (but not used )
todo:
- sms -done (22.8.)
- add another state: idle -i.e. just process is found (by startClients.bash)

27.2.2012 -html added (bin/startClients.bash modified to return pid:N)

Problem:
at SOR/EOR and if time sharing active, it can happen, we get some triggers 
without cal. triggers -particularly for MUON_TRG (calib every 5secs (was 33!)).
Solution: from 22.3.2012
readctp.c should send udp message ONLY if interval is >59secs. 
The interval shorter/equal than 59 secs is discarded and the last 
reading is regarded as '1st reading'.
Before: shorter interval was not considered for calib calculation, 
but the time of previous reading
was stored -i.e. the interval was than included in next interval.

20.7. 2012
pydim added (i.e. startClients.bash returns "pid: ..." if on
i.e. monitor-able daemons now: udpmon pydim html gcalib

17.10. 2012
control better, still not complete...
26.10.2012
ttcmidim instead of pydim i.e., now monitored:
udpmon gcalib ttcmidim html
28.11.2012
udpmon gcalib ctpwsgi ttcmidim html
29.5.2013
autor (autorestart: y|n) option added. pydim added with autor='n'. Now
monitoring: udpmon gcalib ctpwsgi ttcmidim html pydim
14.6.
.html:

system state AUTOR time last
START  STOP        time previous action

24.6.
hddtemp added:
- sms in case of high temperature, but 
- not when it comes back to normal- should be done with some hysteresis
16.7.
hddtemp improved -hysteresis when hddtemp high/ok
19.9.2014
hddtemp -no sense on alidcscom835:
[trigger@alidcscom835 NOTES]$ hddtemp /dev/sda
/dev/sda: Dell VIRTUAL DISK: S.M.A.R.T. not available

may 2016 udp expected/monitored from miclock 1/min!
25.6. 2016 roman sms added when  xcounters down
summer 2017 mnt521 added
7.11.2017 fileage added monitoring gmonscal through the age if its inputs.png

autumn 2020 checkdns added. See checkdimdns.sh script in bin
